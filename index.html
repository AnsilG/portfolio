                <h3 class="head">Starting Figma (2012)</h3><br>
                <p class="car para">Field was named a Thiel Fellow in 2012, earning him $100,000 in exchange for taking a
                    leave of
                    absence from college. The Thiel Fellowship was begun in 2011. At the time, the Thiel Fellowship was
                    designed to select 20 "creative and motivated young people" under the age of 20 each year.
                    Recipients were given $100,000 each to leave college for two years and work on their ideas as
                    startup companies Field viewed it as "almost like an independent study, just you don't get
                    course credit, it's a little bit longer and you get paid. An executive with the Thiel Fellowship
                    commented on their selection of Field: "He has a wonderful blend – he is obviously technically very
                    talented – but he also has a sense of intuition for the art that he will use in his current project,
                    which is blending art and engineering.

                    In summer 2012 Field co-founded Figma with Evan Wallace, who joined Field in California after
                    completing his degree in computer science that spring

                    Field's original objective was to "make it so that anyone can be creative by creating free, simple,
                    creative tools in a browser. Field and Wallace tried many different ideas, including software
                    for drones and a meme generator. The company was described in a 2012 article by The Brown Daily
                    Herald more vaguely as "a technology startup that will allow users to creatively express themselves
                    online. That article reported that the company's first ideas revolved around 3D content
                    generation, and subsequent ideas focused on photo editing and object segmentation</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="head">Other Activities</h2><br>
                <p class="car para">Field is an angel investor in venture-backed startups and an NFT collector. Field
                    purchased his first
                    CryptoPunk NFT in January 2018. He later described himself thinking at the time, "this is probably
                    the stupidest thing I've ever done. In 2021 it was reported that Field sold a CryptoPunk NFT
                    for $7.5 million USD, the highest ever sale price for a CryptoPunk. In the days afterward, Field
                    discussed the sale on The Good Time Show, a popular Clubhouse show, comparing the sold NFT to "a
                    digital Mona Lisa".

                    This was Field's second reported sale, after a $1.5 million USD sale in February 2021. As of March
                    2021, Field owned 11 other CryptoPunks as well as NFTs from Autoglyphs and Beeple. At that time,
                    Forbes reported Field's profits from collecting to be $9.5 million USD.[14] Forbes reported in 2021
                    that Field was an angel investor in OpenSea, an NFT marketplace startup founded by Devin Finzer—a
                    friend of Field's from Brown.</p><br><br>
